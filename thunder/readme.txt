Additionals:

1.	We designed thoughtful levels to play, 
	they are not overly difficult, but we hope you will enjoy them :)
2.	We added colors to the game. 
	You can easily turn off colors in the main menu for a simpler look.
3.  we added a bit of physics to the blocks, you can push blocks off the ship's "back"
    if you push them to a wall or if another ship pushes them (given that the other ship can push them).
